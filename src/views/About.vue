    <p>At the moment the data is source from <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19">Johns Hopkins CSSE</a>.</p>
    <br/>
    The accuracy of the data is a huge question of debate. <br/>
    France for example only reports deaths that happen in hospitals or in care homes. <br/>
    England for example only reports deaths that happen in hospitals. They recently added the <b>some</b> care homes to that number : Up to 28 April, the figures included only those hospital deaths where a patient had received a positive Covid-19 test. Since 29 April, the figures have included non-hospital deaths in England. <br/>
    As mentioned in that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/05/why-no-10s-covid-19-death-toll-slides-dont-tell-the-whole-story">article from the Guardian</a> : he UKâ€™s daily figures only included deaths where the patient tested positive for Covid-19. The Belgian figures included all suspected cases regardless of whether a test was carried out. The way Spain and Italy count their figures is similar to the UK. <br/>
    Some people consider that the numbers are inflated.
